## ManageProfile Class

This class includes the GUI for the user to view their current information and edit it if they so choose. The user can also delete their account. When the user selects an option for what information to edit, it opens a text box for them to input their new information and edits it where the current information is displayed. It also changes the information kept in all other classes where it is kept.
